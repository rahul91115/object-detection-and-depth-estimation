Object detection using YOLOV3 and depth estimation with Camera and Lidar
YOLOv3 is a fast, real-time object detection model that identifies and locates multiple objects in images or videos by treating detection as a single regression problem. It utilizes a deep convolutional network called Darknet-53 for improved speed and accuracy, capable of multi-scale predictions. Depth estimation through camera and LiDAR fusion combines the high-resolution visual data from cameras with precise distance information from LiDAR sensors, offering detailed 3D representations of environments. This method leverages the strengths of both sensors: cameras for texture and color, and LiDAR for accurate depth measurements. The fusion is essential in applications like autonomous driving and robotics, where real-time, accurate environmental understanding is critical.
